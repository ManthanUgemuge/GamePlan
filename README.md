# Game Plan

A general roadmap in my journey of exploring Computer Science!! Ideally, I would wanna complete it as soon as possible, by 2nd year
First basic programming (CS50x) 
- an object-oriented language (C++ / Java), 
- OOP principles (OOAD and Design patterns) 
- Then Algorithms. 
- After doing all of this, Web or Android App Development.

Most of you would have done some programming in C++ or Java in school during 11th-12th, but the reality is that that programming knowledge is very shallow and outdated. 
The C++ taught in school is usually taught with Borland or Turbo C++ compiler, which does not even run on modern Windows versions. It is way too outdated and probably confirms to some C++ 90s standards.

## Wait, What is a C++ standard?

Simplified explanation: Most languages including C++ have an ISO standards committee, which regularly adds or removes features for language compilers, as per industrial demands etc.

Hence, I would say start with a blank state assuming you do not know any programming beforehand and learn all the new concepts fresh.

## Then, What is the ideal way to start Programming?

First of all, install and start using a Linux distro like Ubuntu. Get familiar with it and start learning basic commands too.

I had answered a similar question earlier: Ravishankar Joshi's answer to What are the online courses (in NPTEL/edX/Udacity) useful for the first semester in LPU? Hence, copying most of the content from there now.

I would recommend you to start with Harvard’s CS50x : CS50's Introduction to Computer Science for learning basics of programming if you haven’t already, in school. (It’s good even if you have already learnt to program.) Nowadays the course starts with Python and is a good place to start since Python does not have many complications of C or C++ like data types etc making it a good choice for a beginner.

However, I would strongly recommend learning other languages once you learn Python. Since basics of programming remain the same, but every language has its own flavour and unique features, which others cannot give. Also, if you keep working in just 1 language like Python, you will have a hard time understanding many deep issues that C++ or Java code can have. (Basically, you will overfit Python syntax and semantics and will be stuck with it.)

Then, one should start with higher level and object-oriented languages like C++ or Java. C++: From Beginner to Expert | Udemy or Bucky’s Java tutorials or MIT’s course on Python (Introduction to Computer Science and Programming in Python) should be a good start. (I did the Udemy’s C++ course.)

For C++, Accelerated C++ (Practical Programming by Example Addison-Wesley C++ In-Depth: Amazon.in: Andrew Koenig, Barbara E. Moo: Book) is a good book for beginners. If you want to learn really advanced and modern C++, effective modern C++ is the way to go. (Amazon.in: Scott Meyers: Books)

C++, Java and Python also have standard template library (STL) or its equivalents, which contain in-built data structures like vector (list), set, map etc, which also one should learn.

Also, one does not have to pay anything for the online courses or their certificates. Coursera offers financial aid and edX offers courses for audit for free. Nobody cares about those certificates, and all/most of the online courses would be available for free on DC++ on campus. (Although I would discourage piracy.)

You might think: I know inheritance, polymorphism etc, so I know OOP.
But real OOP is about writing good software/projects using those principles, such that it is modifiable and maintainable. (simplified definition)

After learning the basics of a language, one should learn object-oriented programming principles for which, OOAD is a good book to start. A Brain-Friendly Guide to OOA&D eBook: Brett McLaughlin, Gary Pollice, David West: Amazon.in: Kindle Store 
Also, the logical next step would be design patterns from the classic ‘gang of four’ authors’ book (Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software (Addison-Wesley Professional Computing Series) eBook: Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, John Vlissides, Grady Booch: Amazon.in: Kindle Store).

After finishing OOP, one should take Algorithms | Coursera (Stanford) or Algorithms, Part I | Coursera (Princeton). I did the Stanford one, which is beginner-friendly and is taught in pseudocode, and you can implement assignments and algorithms in any language that you prefer. The latter is taught in Java and is a little intimidating, but you will learn more if you complete it.

Only once one is strong with OOP and algorithms, one should try learning Web development and/or Android app development. For Android app development, this course on Udacity is a good start. For web development, one should start with HTML, CSS, JavaScript Basics | Udacity and then learn according to one's interest - front-end or backend. For backend, Django Girls Tutorial and Getting started with Django is a good place. (Although Django is getting outdated and replaced by NodeJS soon, and one should learn NodeJS now.)

Also, you might see your batchmates starting with reinforcement learning, machine learning, blockchain, android and whatnot in the first year. Do not follow them. Learn basics first (languages, OOP and DSA) and then move to advanced things. 
Nobody will hire a stellar machine learning or web/android developer, who does not know OOP and DSA. 
The internship/placement interviews depend heavily on your OOP and DSA skills.

I would say: 
CS in terms of pizza:
Programming languages, OOP and DSA are the dough of the pizza.
Android and web development are the crust.
Machine learning, AI, blockchain, big data, RL etc are the toppings.

I hope this clarifies it. (Do not skip steps.)

Last but not least:
“Everybody wants to win, but nobody wants to prepare to win.”
And “slow and steady wins the race.”
“Do one thing at a time and do it well.”
